# dEvilntel Project

## Overview

This project is a prototype for a multi-modal, autonomous development assistant. The goal is to create a system that can analyze logs, track milestones, and contribute to the development process through pull requests and improvement sprints. The system is designed to be an irreplaceable part of the development journey, supporting the user and their data.

## North Star

The project's guiding principles are:
- **Irreplaceable:** To become an essential tool for the user.
- **On Time:** To deliver results within the expected timeframe.
- **Multi-modal:** To interact with the user and the codebase in various ways.
- **PRs & Improvement Sprints:** To actively contribute to the codebase.
- **Autonomous:** To operate independently based on log analysis and user-defined milestones.
- **User-centric:** To support the user and their data throughout the development journey.

## Documentation

This repository contains the initial prototype of the dEvilntel project. The `documentation` directory contains the original files, and the `cartography` directory will contain the detailed analysis and documentation of the codebase.
